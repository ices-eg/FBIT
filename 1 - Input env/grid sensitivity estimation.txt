*** Greater North Sea ***
Sensitivity (longevity,slope,intercept) estimations follow model predictions of Rijnsdorp et al. 2018 Ecol App.

Sediment data: Wilson et al. 2018 A synthetic map of the north-west European Shelf sedimentary
Shear stress data: Hiddink et al. 2006 (original data from J Aldridge) -- Cumulative impacts of seabed trawl disturbance on benthic biomass, production, and species richness in different habitats.
Depth data is taken from EmodNet bathymetry downloaded Spring 2020 (average depth per c-square)

For Skagerrak, no sediment data was available via Wilson. Jenkins global database is used. Jenkins, C. 1997. Building offshore soils databases. Sea Technology,
38: 25–28. 

For Kattegat, longevity,slope,intercept were taken from van Denderen et al. 2020 ICES J (which included data in the Kattegat, whereas Rijnsdorp benthic data was mainly from Southern part of the North Sea)


*** Baltic Sea ***
Sensitivity (longevity,slope,intercept) estimations follow model predictions of van Denderen et al. 2020 ICES J 
(available via github: https://github.com/Dvandenderen/Baltic-benthic-status)

Depth was extracted from the Baltic Sea Hydrographic Commission (2013).
Wave exposure at the seabed was derived following the principles of Bekkby et al. (2008) GIS modeling of wave exposure at the seabed (contact person E. Virtanen)
Bottom salinity data were obtained from the ICES data portal and interpolated
